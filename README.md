algorithmic_puzzles
===================

Try to solve a puzzle a day from the book "algorithmic puzzles".

# Repo Structure
Each folder has a statement of the puzzle along with some solution
strategies and implementations in at least one language. My favorite
language is Ruby so most solutions will just be in Ruby.
